# The game has just started, and Cyber is talking to himself. 
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Looks like that's the l-last of 'em!
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|Nice work.
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|Just so we're clear...
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|All I gotta do is blow up this giant 'nest' thing?
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|Correct.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|The Grimidean Vaslings pose a potential threat to the Northern Galaxies.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|We need that threat neutralized.
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|Then once I come back, I'm free to go?
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|That's right.  You'll be pardoned of all your crimes.
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|It all seems too good to be true...
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|These are desperate times, Cyber.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|Ever since the latest Civil war began, we've had to 
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|resort to some unsavory tactics. 
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|Long story short, your criminal infamy is a major asset to us.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|The Grimidean Vaslings could really complicate our fight 
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|against the southern colonies.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|S-s-sorry to interrupt but I'm reading a really large
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|energy signature coming up...
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|Cyber, regroup with your squad up ahead.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|You've entered their territory now.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|Prepare to fight...
