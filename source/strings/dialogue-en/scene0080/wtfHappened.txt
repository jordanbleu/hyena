# Cyber is full on hallucinating, he's about to get his first powerup
cleoNeutralAnim|Cleo|Cyber?  Are you there??
cleoNeutralAnim|Cleo|Cyber!?
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|I'm here...
cleoNeutralAnim|Cleo|We lost communication with you for a sec.
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|I don't know what happened.  It's like I was seeing things...
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|If you are psychologically unfit for this mission+
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|we will abort immediately.
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|Then what happens?
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|You'll be dropped right back into your cell.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|Your execution will be then be rescheduled.
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|Yeah.  Thought so.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Cyber, it looks like y-y-your ship got an upgrade!
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|Huh?
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Your ship is designed to absorb Grimidean energy.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|It then p-processes it and uses it to enable+
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|additional weapons.
# cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|How does that work?
# socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Honestly...we don't know.
# socketNeutralAnim|Socket|There hasn't been much research into Grimidean energy.
# socketNeutralAnim|Socket|From our observations it seems to defy the laws of physics. 
# socketNeutralAnim|Socket|It doesn't create or destroy.  It's like it has a mind of its own.
# cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|So for all you guys know, once I reach the nest+
# cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|I could be cooked alive or something.
# socketNeutralAnim|Socket|We're p-pretty sure that w-w-won't happen.
# socketNeutralAnim|Socket|But, the closer you get to the n-n-nest, the higher the energy+
# socketNeutralAnim|Socket|concentration will b-be.
# socketNeutralAnim|Socket|More weapons will c-c-c-c-continue to activate on your ship.
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|Interesting. Also...
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|Does Grimidean energy cause hallucinations in humans?
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Not from what we've seen.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|Cyber, there's more Grimidean Vaslings coming your way.
seraphNeutralAnim|Seraph|You're on your own this time.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Try out your new weapon by pressing and holding ~.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|The m-meter in the top right of your HUD shows+
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Grimidean energy levels.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Using weapons and dashing costs energy.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|But attacking the Vaslings releases energy, which is+
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|absorbed by your ship.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Over time, your ship's Grimidean energy levels will adjust+
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|back to a neutral level.
cyberNeutralAnim|Cyber|Got it.  So I gotta make every shot count.
socketNeutralAnim|Socket|Exactly!  Otherwise you c-could run out of energy.
